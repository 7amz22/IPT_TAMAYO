    <p class="bglove">So my background in love is a long-distance relationship, and it didn't last for yearsâ€”just about 3 months, I think. I regret the things I did to her; I know I made mistakes. I hope to be better in my next relationship.</p>
    <P class="fvartist">My favorite artist is Josh Hartnett. He plays multiple roles on screen, showcasing his incredible versatility and talent. He has been my idol since I was a kid. I see myself represented by him.</P>
    <p class="fvplayer">My favorite player is TenZ because he represents me; I see myself in him. He is so good at Valorant and has been my idol since I started playing in 2020. I hope to meet him in the future.</p>
    <p class="hbbies">My hobbies include playing online games like League of Legends and Valorant. In League of Legends, I reached Grandmaster, and in Valorant, I achieved Immortal. I'm still playing both games</p>
